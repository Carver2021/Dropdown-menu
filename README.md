# Dropdown-menu
Dropdown menu flutter.. not goin so well

so I  am following Smartherd on Youtube.. . his tutorials on Fluttter.. with a dropdown menu...
there is a code problem but I am scrrewed if I cna see the problem.,. I welcome some help.

and before you hammer me for being simple.. I started writing Dart code less than 3 months ago.. 
so be constructiuve and helpful.... 

this id the Flutter tutorial 3.4 .. adding a dropdown button... Im sure its something simple.. but I'm not seeing it.
I did try a simple copy paste from his source code on GitHUb... and that did not solve the problem.
